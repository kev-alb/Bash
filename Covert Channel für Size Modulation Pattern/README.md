This folder contains all files and scripts to impelement a covert channel of the [Size Modulation](http://ih-patterns.blogspot.com/p/p1-size-modulation-pattern.html) hiding pattern. The covert channel mainly relies on `ncat`. See the [approach description](https://github.com/kev-alb/Bash/blob/master/Covert%20Channel%20für%20Size%20Modulation%20Pattern/Description_of_the_approach.txt) for more details.

Additionally, the file [Size_Mod_1000_1001_300ms_0925_1800.pcap.csv](https://github.com/kev-alb/Bash/blob/master/Covert%20Channel%20für%20Size%20Modulation%20Pattern/Size_Mod_1000_1001_300ms_0925_1800.pcap.csv) is a recording of such a channel. This file contains only packets with payload sizes of 1,000 and 1,001 bytes (excluding the packets of the TCP handshake).
